# PyMIDA

PyMIDA is a graphical user interface python package that allows users to perform mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). 

This program can calculate the fraction of newly synthesized molecules, the turnover rate of polymers, the isotopic enrichment of the precursor pool, and the number of atoms that are replaced or exchanged during metabolic processes. 

# Installation and Requirements

This package requires Python 3.x and has the following codependencies:
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* PyQT5

To run the program, simply download the `isotopomer` folder and run it from the command line `python isotopomer` or `python3 isotopomer`, depending on how you add Python 3 to your path.
